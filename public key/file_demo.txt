I took a pill in Ibiza To show Avicii I was cool And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older But fuck it, it was something to do I'm living out in LA I drive a sports car just to prove I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars And I spend it on girls and shoes But you don't wanna be high like me Never really knowing why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be All alone You don't wanna ride the bus like this Never knowing who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing Stuck up on that stage singing All I know Are sad songs, sad songs Darling, all I know Are sad songs, sad songs I know, are sad songs I know, are sad songs I know, are sad songs I know, are sad songs I'm just a singer Who already blew his shot I get along with old timers cause my name's a reminder Of a pop song people forgot And I can't keep a girl, no Cause as soon as the sun comes up I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse But the truth is I can't open up And you don't wanna be high like me Never really knowing why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be All alone You don't wanna ride the bus like this Never knowing who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing Stuck up on that stage singing All I know Are sad songs, sad songs Darling, all I know Are sad songs, sad songs I know, are sad songs I know, are sad songs Sad songs I know, are sad songs Sad songs I know, are sad songs
